# 2023 SANS SOC Survey Review 

**Speaker:** Christopher Crowley

# Abstract

In its 7th year, the SOC Survey continues to be a valuable source of peer comparison for Cybersecurity 
Operations Centers. Christopher Crowley, Founder of Montance®, has authored this survey for each of its 
editions. He will provide insights, unknowns, and some details of the analysis performed to author the 
document of more than six hundreds SOCs surveyed.

Crowley will review key findings from the 2023 survey: SOC capabilities, funding, staffing, and 
challenges. He’ll discuss how SOCs use Threat Intelligence, what technology gets good grades, and 
which technologies are failing to fulfill their promise.

After executive summary highlights of some survey findings, he’ll delve into details using the public 
release data from the survey responses. This includes a quick fundamentals review of the setup for 
Jupyter notebook, pandas, and seaborn.

Then, using this environment he’ll discuss analysis considerations starting from data cleaning issues 
and moving into more advanced analysis. He’ll also provide instructions and code samples that would 
allow attendees to answer their own questions from the released data. Attendees can download the python 
Jupyter notebook and data set to follow along during the presentation, or work on afterward.

This session gives you the headlines, but also the skills to get into the details if you choose. Or, 
you can come watch and laugh along with him as he typos his way through the python and pandas code.
