# Beyond the Shell: Unconventional Agents for Red Teaming Success

**Speaker:** Cody Thomas

# Abstract

In this presentation, we delve into the uncharted territories of offensive security using the Mythic C2 
platform. Moving beyond traditional red teaming approaches, we explore unconventional agents that 
redefine how operators interact with target environments. Discover the power of remotely controlling 
webshells seamlessly alongside beaconing agents from a unified interface, and the creation of agents 
designed not to act directly on victim systems but to intelligently interact with external services, 
such as Bloodhound, Ghostwriter, or Nemesis. Join us as we unravel Mythic’s versatility and uncover 
innovative strategies for achieving red teaming success in today’s dynamic cybersecurity landscape.
