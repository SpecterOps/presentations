# Project Apeman: Mapping AWS Identity Attack Paths

**Speaker:** Daniel Heinsen

# Abstract

In the evolving landscape of cloud security, automating identity attack path discovery has emerged as a 
critical strategy for mitigating cyber threats. This talk delves into the concept of “Tier 0” security 
within the AWS ecosystem and introduces Apeman, a novel prototype tool designed to map and visualize 
AWS identity attack paths. The discussion will also delve into the challenges encountered during 
Apeman’s development.
