# Misconfiguration Manager: Overlooked and Overprivileged

**Speakers**: Duane Michael & Chris Thompson

# Abstract

Configuration Manager (SCCM) attack paths have become more and more common recently. The impact of these 
attack paths is significant, as they often directly lead to domain compromise, else enable it. In this 
talk we discuss some of the most critical and common SCCM attack paths weâ€™ve discovered and abused in 
the wild and how to best mitigate and manage them. Additionally, we introduce a model for SCCM attack 
path management that can be used by both red and blue.
