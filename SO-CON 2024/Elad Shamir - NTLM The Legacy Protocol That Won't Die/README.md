# NTLM: The Legacy Protocol That Won't Die

**Speaker:** Elad Shamir

# Abstract

As we enter 2024, the legacy of NetNTLM, a 30-plus-year-old authentication protocol, continues looming 
over enterprise security. Despite Microsoft’s advice against its use since 2010, NTLM’s deprecation 
remains a challenge. Contrary to the belief of most security practitioners who consider NTLM-related 
attacks to be a solved problem or of negligible risk, attackers have been developing advanced adversary 
tradecraft abusing NTLM for decades, and it is now one of the most effective avenues for compromising 
internal systems, including Active Directory and the entire enterprise identity infrastructure.

In this talk, we delve deep into the world of NTLM, uncovering the most impactful techniques for 
exploiting its vulnerabilities. We’ ll review sophisticated NTLM-related attacks orchestrated by 
top-tier threat actors, highlighting tradecraft that remains largely unknown in the security community. 
Our journey will traverse the evolution of NTLM, from its basic concepts to advanced real-world relay 
scenarios, including subtle yet impactful abuses.

But there’s more than just exposing the problem. We’ll engage in a solution-oriented discussion, 
exploring effective mitigation strategies, Microsoft’s plans for addressing these vulnerabilities, 
and the practical challenges in eradicating NTLM’s legacy. Whether you’re a seasoned security 
professional or new to the field, this presentation will equip you with a nuanced understanding of 
NTLM’s current risks and prepare you to better attack or defend networks against these enduring threats.
