The Dog Ate my Homework: (Re)building a PowerShell Module for the New BloodHound

**Speaker:** JD Douillard

# Abstract

BloodHound has been my faithful companion for some years now, so I was really excited when the BloodHound team 
announced the release of the new BloodHound Community Edition earlier last yearâ€¦ but then I quickly realized most of 
the custom BloodHound tooling I had built over the years wouldn't work anymore in the new BloodHound version.
Past a moment of despair, and rather than trying to adapt my old tooling to all the breaking changes and new features, 
I decided it would be better to rebuild it from scratch...

In this talk, I will explain some of the main differences between the old and the new BloodHound, I will introduce the
BloodHound Operator PowerShell module - a set of cmdlets to interact with the new BloodHound REST API - and I will 
demonstrate some of the new automation opportunities BloodHound CE has to offer.

If you love BloodHound and you like PowerShell command-line kung-fu, this talk is for you...
