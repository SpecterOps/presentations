# Graphs are Hard

**Speakers:** John Hopper & Rohan Vazarkar

# Abstract

Security domains like Microsoft Entra, Active Directory, AWS IAM and others are highly complex and 
difficult to examine. BloodHound is a tool that utilizes graph constructs to make these domains easier 
to reason with to shorten time to discovery of interesting attack vectors. Throughout SpecterOpsâ€™ 
journey in producing BloodHound with a focus on Attack Path Management there have been many engineering 
hurdles that we have had to overcome. This talk dissects several of the problems encountered and the 
engineering solutions employed to solve them.
