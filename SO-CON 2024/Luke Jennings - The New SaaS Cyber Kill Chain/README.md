# The New SaaS Cyber Kill Chain

**Speaker:** Luke Jennings

# Abstract

Once upon a time, we thought of cyber attacks in terms of recon, port scanning, enumeration, 
vulnerability identification and exploitation and we had various approaches we would use to frustrate 
attackers at every phase. As the cat and mouse game of security continued, this eventually morphed 
into an endpoint compromise focused process involving initial access, exploitation, persistence, 
command and control and lateral movement inside a complex internal network. But with the remote 
working and SaaS revolution, the way organizations work has changed radically – so what does the 
cyber kill chain look like now?

This talk will consider what a new SaaS cyber kill chain looks like for modern organizations that 
are fully SaaS native without any concept of an internal network, and the surprising number of attacks 
that are possible without touching company owned endpoints or infrastructure. We will consider topics 
like how the initial access stage is changing due to the availability of so many potential beachheads, 
what lateral movement looks like in a world with no internal infrastructure to migrate to and how 
persistence methods have changed and are much more resilient to common containment measures such as 
password resets and secure device wipes. Finally, we’ll consider how the open-source SaaS attacks 
matrix can be used by both red and blue teams to help navigate this new world.
