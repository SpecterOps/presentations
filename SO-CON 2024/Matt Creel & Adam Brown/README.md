# Manually Enumerating AD Attack Paths with BOFHound

**Speakers:** Matt Creel & Adam Brown

# Abstract

Red team operators are often faced with the conundrum of running SharpHound and risking detection, 
or fighting the uphill battle of mapping Active Directory attack paths without BloodHound’s aid. 
In this talk, we’ll examine a workflow that grants operators granular control over the speed and depth 
of Active Directory enumeration, while still leveraging the power of BloodHound’s relationship mapping 
and Cypher queries. The discussion will also cover common SharpHound detection strategies and how to 
account for them when approximating a SharpHound data collection.
