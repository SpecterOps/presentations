# Attack Path Based Detection Engineering: Leveraging BloodHound for Robust Defense

**Speaker:** Olaf Hartong

# Abstract

Dive deep into the world of BloodHound, a tool that has revolutionized the way we identify and analyze 
attack paths. Despite its benefits, we encounter many teams that struggle to maximize its potential 
due to time constraints or knowledge gaps. This talk aims to bridge these gaps, unveiling tips and 
tricks to keep your BloodHound database up-to-date and use it for automatic detection and enrichment.

We’re excited to introduce you to FalconHound, a toolkit designed to augment BloodHound’s capabilities. 
Discover how FalconHound integrates with a host of security tools, offering features like tracking 
sessions, environment changes, alerts, and incidents – all in near-real time!

Embrace the power of bi-directional contextual information to prioritize critical alerts better and 
stop attackers in their tracks before they reach their goal. Learn how tools like BloodHound and 
FalconHound can serve as extensions of your live monitoring capabilities, helping you catch attackers 
in real-time and limit the impact of breaches. One of the coolest features is the ability to track 
active lateral movement, which allows the possibility to stop an attacker in their tracks.
