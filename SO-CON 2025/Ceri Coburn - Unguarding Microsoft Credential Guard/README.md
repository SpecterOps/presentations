# Unguarding Microsoft Credential Guard

**Speaker:** Ceri Coburn

## Abstract

Microsoft has implemented Credential Guard to thwart attackers from stealing primary credentials from LSASS. During this talk, we will cover how both Credential Guard and Remote Credential Guard work, along with how the Kerberos credential provider was exploited to give up the keys to the kingdom. A new version of Rubeus will also be demonstrated and released, featuring additional capabilities to help in environments where Credential Guard is active.
