# LSA Whisperer - The Cloud Update

**Speaker:** Evan McBroom

## Abstract

At SO-CON 2024, we introduced LSA Whisperer, a tool for interacting with LSA authentication packages. The presentation covered multiple new credential recovery techniques. This year, we will do the same and present new credential recovery techniques that were developed since the tool's initial release. We will also cover other tool updates that were added to make the tool ready to use on a security assessment.
