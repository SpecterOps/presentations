# The Certificate Strikes Back: ADCS's Path to Azure

**Speaker:** Fletcher Davis

## Abstract

As organizations embrace Microsoft Entra's Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA) to enhance security through phishing-resistant X.509 certificates, a new attack surface emerges where misconfigured on-premise PKI extends its reach into the cloud. This talk explores techniques to weaponize Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) to gain access to the cloud through certificate template abuse and enrollment service manipulation. Traditional ADCS misconfigurations chain perfectly into modern cloud Attack Paths, transforming compromised PKI into a gateway for circumventing MFA, privilege escalation, and persistent access in Microsoft Entra environments.

From red teamers to detection engineers to security architects, this technical deep-dive will change how you view hybrid identity security and reveal why your certificate problems don't end at the domain controller.
