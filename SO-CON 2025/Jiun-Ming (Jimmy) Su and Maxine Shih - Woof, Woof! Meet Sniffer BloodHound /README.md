# Woof, Woof! Meet Sniffer BloodHound: An Algorithm-Driven Framework for Attack Path Analysis

**Speaker:** Jiun-Ming (Jimmy) Su and Maxine Shih

## Abstract

Analyzing Attack Paths with BloodHound can become challenging in large-scale environments due to graph complexity and the difficulty in prioritizing critical edges for mitigation or defining unblockable edges.

To address these issues, we introduce Sniffer BloodHound, an algorithm-driven framework seamlessly integrated into BloodHound. Based on the algorithm proposed by Mingyu Guo in AAAI 2023, which already supports critical edge identification and self-defined unblockable edges, we have further refined and extended its capabilities.

Our enhancements focus on automating Attack Path prioritization, enabling self-defined Tier 0 asset analysis, and supporting multi-destination analysis to accommodate diverse attack scenarios.

Fully integrated within the BloodHound UI, Sniffer BloodHound significantly reduces analysis time and improves accuracy, empowering red and blue teams to efficiently detect and disrupt Attack Paths.
