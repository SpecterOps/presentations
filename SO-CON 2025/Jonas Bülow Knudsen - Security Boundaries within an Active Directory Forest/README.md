# Security Boundaries within an Active Directory Forest

**Speaker:** Jonas BÃ¼low Knudsen

## Abstract

For those in AD security, the phrase "the domain is not a security boundary; the forest is" is well-known. But does this mean no security boundaries exist within a forest, allowing all users full control of everything? That cannot be right. So, where are the boundaries in a multi-domain forest?
