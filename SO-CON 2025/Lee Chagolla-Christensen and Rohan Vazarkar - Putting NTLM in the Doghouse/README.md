# Putting NTLM in the Doghouse

**Speaker:** Lee Chagolla-Christensen and Rohan Vazarkar

## Abstract

For over 25 years, the NTLM protocol has plagued Windows environments. Despite countless warnings and mitigation guides, even mature, well-resourced organizations remain vulnerable to its weaknesses, making NTLM relay a go-to technique for offensive teams to fully compromise Active Directory environments. In this talk, we'll discuss our research into modeling NTLM relay attacks within BloodHound. We'll highlight details about the developed model, the engineering involved, and how security teams can use BloodHound to detect, exploit, and mitigate NTLM's many problems throughout an environment.
