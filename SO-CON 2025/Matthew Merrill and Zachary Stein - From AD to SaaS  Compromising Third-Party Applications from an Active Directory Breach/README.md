# From AD to SaaS: Compromising Third-Party Applications from an Active Directory Breach

**Speaker:** Matthew Merrill and Zachary Stein

## Abstract

In todayâ€™s complex enterprise environments, understanding and managing Attack Paths is critical for maintaining a robust security posture. This presentation explores the journey of an attacker who initially compromises an Active Directory (AD) environment and progressively abuses various attack paths, ultimately breaching a third-party application. The session will focus on the key components of Attack Path Management, with a particular emphasis on the impact of unauthorized access to critical systems and third-party applications.
