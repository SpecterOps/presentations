# Hunting SMB Shares with Data, Graphs, Charts, and LLMs

**Speaker:** Scott Sutherland

## Abstract

Every hacker has a story about abusing SMB shares, but it’s an attack surface that cybersecurity teams still struggle to understand, manage, and defend. In this presentation, we’ll cover simple but effective data analysis techniques to identify, understand, attack, and remediate SMB shares in Active Directory environments. The session will include demos showcasing how these techniques can be applied using PowerShell, Neo4j, Cytoscape, and PowerHuntShares.
