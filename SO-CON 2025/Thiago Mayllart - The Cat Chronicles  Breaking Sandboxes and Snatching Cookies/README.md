# The Cat Chronicles: Breaking Sandboxes and Snatching Cookies

**Speaker:** Thiago Mayllart

## Abstract

In this talk, I will reveal multiple practical attack techniques that can be used to improve your Red Team simulations. We will cover an unpublished macro sandbox bypass, a new tool to hijack one of the most interesting macOS attack surfaces, and a JAMF technique for elevating privileges.

We will begin by revisiting Office macros and diving into cookies and browser interactions. I will introduce two new tools exclusively at this conference: a Mythic agent named Bowser, designed to hijack browser sessions, and Blender, created to capture cookies with a new method. As a bonus, we will combine these techniques to elevate our privileges, showing how JAMF can be abused to bypass TCC."
